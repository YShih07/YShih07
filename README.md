## About Me

- 👋 Hi, I'm Yu Shi.
- 🌍 Originally from China, I now call Madrid my home.
- 🎓 I'm a student with a strong passion for technology.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm delving into the world of big data.
- 💼 My primary interests revolve around coding and modeling.

<p>I'm truly enthusiastic about technology, and my expertise lies in cybersecurity. With 8 years of hands-on experience in this field, I'm fully committed to enhancing security, solving intricate challenges, and actively contributing to the knowledge sharing within the community.
